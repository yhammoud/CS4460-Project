# WildLifeStrikes-Viz
This is a Data Visualization of wildlife strikes.
I used a dataset from the FDA Wildlife Strike DataBase http://wildlife.faa.gov/
-	Done some filtering and processing to the dataset from the FAA website.
-	Used Airport geographical data to visualize the airports on the USA map using D3.js.
-	Used D3.js and Cross-filter to visualize strikesâ€™ by species, year and month for each airport.
